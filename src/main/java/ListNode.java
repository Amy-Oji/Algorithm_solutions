     * LeetCode: <a href="https://leetcode.com/problems/swap-nodes-in-pairs/">Link Here</a>
     * Given a linked list, swap every two adjacent nodes and return its head.
     * You must solve the problem without modifying the values in the list's nodes
     * (i.e., only nodes themselves may be changed.)
     *
     *
     * # Approach
     * Return head if the head is null or if the next to head is null
     * (that means the LinkedList is empty or contains only one element therefore there is nothing to swap)
     *
     * Else...
     * 1. Create a temp Node.
     * 2. Assign the head to temp.next.
     * 3. Create a current Node to be used for iteration and assign temp to it.
     * 4. Iterate using a while-loop with the condition that the next two nodes are not null.
     * 6. Exchange those two Nodesâ€™ values inside the loop and reassign current to the next two nodes after it.
     * 7. Return the head (which I initially assigned to temp.next in my case)
     * **/
